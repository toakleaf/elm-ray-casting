# Elm Raycasting

[Live Demo!](https://elm-ray-casting.netlify.com)

Building a ray casting 2D to 3D projector (a la Wolfenstein 3D) using Elm and HTML5 Canvas.

## Explanation

Usually game design is a very object-oriented endeavour, so I thought it would be a particularly fun challenge to see if I could get ray casting working in a functional language. For a coding interview I had been given a [project to create a 2D grid](https://github.com/toakleaf/elm-demo) to navigate using the language. After whipping that out I decided it'd be a good opportunity to put Elm through it's passes. I quickly found out that Elm has a very limited tool-set for Html5 Canvas and animation, and therefore isn't the most efficient language for this type of thing. However, I had an absolute blast putting this together over about 8 hrs. Even hastily written code looks pretty tidy in Elm.

## Todo:

1.  ~~Setup canvas~~
2.  ~~Build map~~
3.  ~~Add player dot~~
4.  ~~Get player dot moving / turning~~
5.  ~~Fix the choppy animation framerate~~
6.  ~~Collision Detection~~
7.  ~~Calculate FOV rays~~
8.  ~~Calculate ray collisions~~
9.  ~~2D += D~~
10. ~~Color floor/ceiling~~
